        Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition,
        structure, properties and change of matter.Chemistry includes
        topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical
        bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through
        intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the
        interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different
        substances.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chemistry is sometimes called the central science because it bridges other
        natural sciences, including physics, geology and biology. For the
        differences between chemistry and physics see comparison of chemistry
        and physics.

      <div class="textcontent">
        <p>
          Inorganic chemistry deals with the synthesis and behavior of inorganic
          and organometallic compounds. This field covers all chemical compounds
          except the myriad organic compounds (carbon based compounds, usually
          containing C-H bonds), which are the subjects of organic chemistry.
          The distinction between the two disciplines is far from absolute, as
          there is much overlap in the subdiscipline of organometallic chemistry.
          It has applications in every aspect of the chemical industry, including
          catalysis, materials science, pigments, surfactants, coatings, medications,
          fuels, and agriculture.

      <div class="textcontent">
        <p>
          Organic chemistry is the study of the structure, properties, composition,
          reactions, and preparation of carbon-containing compounds, which include
          not only hydrocarbons but also compounds with any number of other elements,
          including hydrogen (most compounds contain at least one carbon–hydrogen bond),
          nitrogen, oxygen, halogens, phosphorus, silicon, and sulfur. This branch
          of chemistry was originally limited to compounds produced by living
          organisms but has been broadened to include human-made substances such
          as plastics. The range of application of organic compounds is enormous
          and also includes, but is not limited to, pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals,
          food, explosives, paints, and cosmetics.

          Physical chemistry is the study of macroscopic, atomic, subatomic,
          and particulate phenomena in chemical systems in terms of the principles,
          practices and concepts of physics such as motion, energy, force, time,
          thermodynamics, quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics, analytical dynamics
          and chemical equilibrium. <b>(From the author: never learn Physical Chem)</b>

          Analytical chemistry is the science of obtaining, processing, and
          communicating information about the composition and structure of matter.
          In other words, it is the art and science of determining what matter
          is and how much of it exists. In 2012 (salary survey data), analytical
          chemistry was the most popular field of work for ACS chemists.

            Supramolecular chemistry is a branch of chemistry and interacts with organic,
            inorganic and physical chemistry. Briefly, this subject studies the
            interaction between molecules and groups of molecules.

            A <b>non-covalent interaction</b> differs from a <b>covalent bond</b> in that it
            does not involve the sharing of electrons, but rather involves more
            dispersed variations of electromagnetic interactions between molecules
            or within a molecule. (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-covalent_interactions">
            Wiki</a> for details.)
